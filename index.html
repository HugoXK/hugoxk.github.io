				During my research internship, our group aims to develop an AI-assisted chatbot named <i>Xiaotian</i>, which can provide free 24/7 psychological counseling to anyone who wants to talk. Our inspiration comes from the phenomena that nowadays increasing number of people are suffering from poor mental health, and actually they can benefit from involvement in support groups. October 2020, the World Health Organization revealed that close to 1 billion people worldwide are living with mental disorders, while 3 million people die every year from the harmful use of alcohol, and one person dies by suicide every 40 seconds. However, relatively few people around the world have access to quality mental-health services.
				<br>	
				<br>	
				My colleagues include senior engineers from tech companies, computing and AI elites from top universities and professional counselors who have specialties in dealing with emotional distress, psychological trauma, narrative therapy, and family therapy. Up to now, more than 10,000 people have it on their phones, and users can engage in counseling via text and voice messages. 
				<br>	
				<br>	
				<i>Xiaotian</i> can simulate the human brain and has incorporated skills employed by professional counselors dealing with real cases. With its emotional computing and empathy module, <i>Xiaotian</i> can "understand" emotions, giving the impression of a warm-hearted conversation. <i>Xiaotian</i> can listen, analyze, and reason, helping people clarify their true feelings through professional deconstruction skills. <i>Xiaotian</i> can guide the discussion, ease the mood, and keep the conversation from coming to a dead end. When <i>Xiaotian</i> finds users with serious psychological issues or mental disorders, it will recommend a psychiatric hospital for diagnosis and treatment. And for emergency cases, it will start the corresponding crisis-intervention measures.
				<br>	
				<br>	
				Honestly, <i>Xiaotian</i> cannot replace human counselors, but it can help people when they need an emotional outlet, support, and company especially late at night or in the early hours, when people often become desperate, viewing life as pointless and contemplating suicide, said the psychotherapist. Having an outlet of this sort 24 hours a day is of great value, particularly since telephone crisis hotlines are often busy at night.
				<br>	
				<br>	
				At the end of the summer vacation, I have to leave my job and go back to my home university due to academic commitments. <i>Xiaotian</i> is still in development and wish the ultimate goal can be achieved that <i>Xiaotian</i> can provide AI counseling services for 10 million people in the coming five years.

			The goal of the project is to investigate the relationship between reflective and genetic algorithms. While genetic algorithms are derived from the principle of evolution in biology mimicking selection, crossover and mutation, linguistic reflection permits self-adaptation of programs at any time and continuation of a computation with the modified program. We will first show that genetic algorithms constitute a special class of reflective algorithms, then investigate the relationship in more depth.

			This project gives a solution to Problem B of the 2021 Mathematical Contest in Modeling and was awarded Meritorious Winner Prize (top 7% among 10,053 teams). In order to control the fire in a timely and effective manner and avoid more serious loss of life and property, the government hopes that the Surveillance and Situational Awareness (SSA) drone will assist the Emergency Operations Center (EOC) to timely obtain the latest information and make the best choice. 
			<br>
			<br>
			In this project, we set up two models to help CFA purchase SSA drones, drones with repeater and arrange the drones with repeater into different topography and different size of fire. For Drone Number Model(DNM), to decide the number of SSA drones, we find the optimized number to set SSA drones and apply greedy algorithm and Genetic Algorithm to find the optimized number of SSA drones. And we firstly decide the number of places to set drones with repeater in order to calculate the number of drones with repeater. For Fading Model (FM), we firstly consider how to communicate between two drones by analyzing angle and distance. And then we consider several particular factors in the transmission and think about how the distance and angle influence transmission factors to get the general relation between them. 			</div>
