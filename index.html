				Currently, the application of machine learning in many domains, such as healthcare and biology, suffers a lot from the lack of labeled data, and it could be time-consuming and requires quite a lot manual work from domain experts to collect sufficient amout of labeled data. This project aims to propose a novel method to do the labeling economically and use knowledge graph efficiently.

				During my research internship, our group aims to develop an AI-assisted chatbot named <i>Xiaotian</i>, which can provide free 24/7 psychological counseling to anyone who wants to talk. Our inspiration comes from the phenomena that nowadays increasing number of people are suffering from poor mental health, and actually they can benefit from involvement in support groups. October 2020, the World Health Organization revealed that close to 1 billion people worldwide are living with mental disorders, while 3 million people die every year from the harmful use of alcohol, and one person dies by suicide every 40 seconds. However, relatively few people around the world have access to quality mental-health services.
				<br>	
				<br>	
				My colleagues include senior engineers from tech companies, computing and AI elites from top universities and professional counselors who have specialties in dealing with emotional distress, psychological trauma, narrative therapy, and family therapy. Up to now, more than 10,000 people have it on their phones, and users can engage in counseling via text and voice messages. 
				<br>	
				<br>	
				<i>Xiaotian</i> can simulate the human brain and has incorporated skills employed by professional counselors dealing with real cases. With its emotional computing and empathy module, <i>Xiaotian</i> can "understand" emotions, giving the impression of a warm-hearted conversation. <i>Xiaotian</i> can listen, analyze, and reason, helping people clarify their true feelings through professional deconstruction skills. <i>Xiaotian</i> can guide the discussion, ease the mood, and keep the conversation from coming to a dead end. When <i>Xiaotian</i> finds users with serious psychological issues or mental disorders, it will recommend a psychiatric hospital for diagnosis and treatment. And for emergency cases, it will start the corresponding crisis-intervention measures.
				<br>	
				<br>	
				Honestly, <i>Xiaotian</i> cannot replace human counselors, but it can help people when they need an emotional outlet, support, and company especially late at night or in the early hours, when people often become desperate, viewing life as pointless and contemplating suicide, said the psychotherapist. Having an outlet of this sort 24 hours a day is of great value, particularly since telephone crisis hotlines are often busy at night.
				<br>	
				<br>	
				At the end of the summer vacation, I have to leave my job and go back to my home university due to academic commitments. <i>Xiaotian</i> is still in development and wish the ultimate goal can be achieved that <i>Xiaotian</i> can provide AI counseling services for 10 million people in the coming five years.

			Nowadays, the single cell RNA sequencing task with machine learning method become more and more popular in the biological research field. And the experiment result shows that the RNA-seq with machine learning can reach very high accurate. Among all these machine learning methods, the unsupervised learning with clustering is very fit for this task. Here, we explore the scETM model, which is a embedded topic modeling that is applied into the RNA-seq task. However, with our deeper research, we find that the batch effect is a big challenge in the RNA-seq model with machine learning. Therefore, we propose a batch correction network to improve the batch correction of scETM model and improve the performance of it.

			The goal of this project is to use Adversarial Learning methods with the help of <a href="https://github.com/jind11/TextFooler">Text-Fooler</a> to verify the robustness of Prompt Learning (both on BERT and RoBERTa) in a large range of NLP tasks, such as sentiment classification and relation extraction. Based on specially designed experiments, we try to evaluate the performance on several commonly used dataset, such as SST-2 and AG, and compare the results with both the performance in original paper and our replicated experiment without attacks. <!-- Unfortunately, for some reasons, such as schedule conflict with my NSF-Support project, inefficient cooperation caused by 13-hour time difference and disagreement about the further research direction, my teammates will continue to work on this project for further perfection in the future.-->

			The goal of this project is to investigate the relationship between reflective and genetic algorithms. While genetic algorithms are derived from the principle of evolution in biology mimicking selection, crossover and mutation, linguistic reflection permits self-adaptation of programs at any time and continuation of a computation with the modified program. We will first show that genetic algorithms constitute a special class of reflective algorithms, then investigate the relationship in more depth.

			The goal of this project is to re-design and implement a game called Stick Figure Badminton on the FPGA as a System-on-chip. This is a two-player game that two stickmen can only move left and right on their own fields and they need to catch the shuttlecock from each other. If one of them fails to make it, including the shuttlecock falls on his field or hit the net, he will lose the game. Two stickmen will be controlled by one keyboard.

			This project gives a solution to Problem B of the 2021 Mathematical Contest in Modeling and was awarded Meritorious Winner Prize (top 7% among 10,053 teams). In order to control the fire in a timely and effective manner and avoid more serious loss of life and property, the government hopes that the Surveillance and Situational Awareness (SSA) drone will assist the Emergency Operations Center (EOC) to timely obtain the latest information and make the best choice. 
			<br>
			<br>
			In this project, we set up two models to help CFA purchase SSA drones, drones with repeater and arrange the drones with repeater into different topography and different size of fire. For Drone Number Model(DNM), to decide the number of SSA drones, we find the optimized number to set SSA drones and apply greedy algorithm and Genetic Algorithm to find the optimized number of SSA drones. And we firstly decide the number of places to set drones with repeater in order to calculate the number of drones with repeater. For Fading Model (FM), we firstly consider how to communicate between two drones by analyzing angle and distance. And then we consider several particular factors in the transmission and think about how the distance and angle influence transmission factors to get the general relation between them. 			</div>
